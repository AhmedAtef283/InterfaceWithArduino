# Interface With Arduino Project make you Control Arduino Board using JavaFx GUI 
Project Idea is to Control electrical components like LEDS , send / recieve data from arduino board using graphical user interdace (GUI) from JavaFX 
this project control leds  , write on Arduino LCD  , get data from potentionmeter.

We control these processes by sending stream of data by setting on action on java GUI , then we recieve it on arduino serial and begin to deal with it and setting on action we need to do on arduino pins.
